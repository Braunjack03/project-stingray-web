## Project Stingray Requirments
The goal is to create a job board website containing company profiles, job seeker profiles, a job board, and news articles about the companies. Our focus in on technlogy companies and start-ups in Florida.  We'll start by limiting our scope to the Tampa Bay area and they'll we'll exapand to Miami and central Florida.


For our Phase 1 MVP we need the following:  
- Two different authenticated user types
    - Employer
    - Job Seeker (also called candidates)
    - Employers can
        - Create a company profile.  This profile will including information about the company including name, location, description, and images.
        - Post jobs.  Employers will have the ability to post 5 jobs for free.  In later project phases we will implement a subscription based model.
    - Job Seekers can:
        - Create a personal profile containing information about themselves.
        - Upload a resume.  In later project phases we will parse the resume using a third party service to make the information searchable.
- Job Board
    -  List of jobs posted by employers 
    -  Free text search as well as the ability to filter based on certain criteria such as job type
- Company news
    - For phase 1 we'll link to blog powered by Wordpress or Ghost.  In later phases we'll build article posting into the platform.
